We organize traveling labs so teams can prototype with us without leaving their neighborhood. Each session mixes quick demos, practical kits, and time for people to adapt tools to their own projects.

## What the mobile lab brings

Our travel kit focuses on essentials so setup takes less than 20 minutes.

- Field-ready sensors with printed wiring guides.
- Tablets with preloaded tutorials and checklists.
- A mini printing station for labels, QR codes, and consent forms.

> **Tip:** If the space already has good connectivity, switch tutorials to online mode and free tablet storage for capturing evidence.

## Co-creation blocks

We divide each visit into three repeatable blocks that any host team can remix:

1. **Orientation (15 min):** Align on the question to explore and safety rules.
2. **Build + test (45 min):** Assemble sensors or narrative elements and document changes.
3. **Close (20 min):** Record voice notes, photos, and next steps in the shared space.

## Handing off the lab

Each host leaves with a light file they can use to run the next session independently:

- A localized copy of checklists and facilitation cues.
- Links to download the same firmware and data templates used onsite.
- A `translationKey` in the Markdown frontmatter that connects this story with its English version, keeping routes in sync across languages.

If you want to add your own article, duplicate this file, translate the body, keep the same `translationKey`, and change the filename to the desired slug. The site will automatically connect versions when they share that key.
