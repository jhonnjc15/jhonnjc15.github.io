**Electrochemical graphene synthesis**  
**Technique:** Anodic exfoliation  
**Level:** Intermediate – Advanced  
**Estimated time:** 2–4 hours  
**Goal:** Obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or graphene via electrochemical exfoliation of graphite.

## ✅ Materials and reagents

**Equipment**
- Direct current (DC) power supply or adjustable bench supply (0–20 V, 0–2 A)
- Graphite electrode (pure graphite rods or bars)
- Counter electrode: stainless steel or graphite
- Electrode holder and alligator-clip cables
- Beaker (250–500 mL)
- Magnetic stirrer (optional)
- Glass stir rod or spatula
- Vacuum filter or Büchner funnel with filter paper

**Reagents (common options)**
- Electrolyte A (mild): Na₂SO₄ (sodium sulfate) 0.1 M
- Electrolyte B (oxidizing): H₂SO₄ (sulfuric acid) 0.1–1 M (⚠️ handle with care)
- Distilled water
- Ethanol (final rinse)

## 🧾 Step-by-step procedure

### 1) Prepare the electrolyte
- Dissolve the selected reagent in distilled water (e.g., 2.84 g Na₂SO₄ in 200 mL for a 0.1 M solution).
- Pour into a 250 mL beaker.

### 2) Assemble the electrochemical system
- Connect a graphite rod as the anode (positive) and another as the cathode (negative).
- Keep them separated by about 3–5 cm.
- Submerge both in the solution without letting them touch.

### 3) Apply voltage
- Turn on the power supply.
- Apply a constant 10–12 V for 30–60 minutes.
- You will observe bubbling (gas release), and the anode will begin shedding thin, dark layers.

### 4) Collect the exfoliated material
- At the end, let the mixture settle or filter it to recover the dark suspended material (graphene).
- Rinse several times with distilled water until neutral pH.
- Rinse once with ethanol.

### 5) Drying
- Dry the filtered material in an oven at 60–80 °C for several hours or air-dry.

## ⚠️ Safety precautions
- Wear gloves, safety goggles, and a lab coat.
- Handle acids with extreme care.
- Use a fume hood if working with H₂SO₄.

## 🧪 Optional – Post-reduction
If graphene oxide is obtained, it can be reduced to rGO using reducing agents such as:

- Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
- Sodium hydrosulfite (Na₂S₂O₄)
- Thermal treatment (>200 °C)

## 📌 Additional notes
- Different conditions can be used to obtain graphene with fewer defects.
- Characterize the product with techniques such as UV-Vis, Raman, SEM/TEM, FTIR, or XRD if equipment is available.
