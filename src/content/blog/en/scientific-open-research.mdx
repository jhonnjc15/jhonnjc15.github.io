Working with scientists and communities requires full transparency. Every project starts with a shared canvas where we register hypotheses, equipment needs, and ethical considerations. That plan guides the hardware design and software flows we build at Paqari Open Lab.

## Open research charter

Our charter is the backbone of each collaboration. It defines roles, contribution guidelines, and how we care for data. Partners review and sign it before building to ensure clear expectations.

### Key points in the charter

- **Shared glossary:** Aligns scientific terms, translations, and local references.
- **Ethics checklist:** Confirms consent flows, anonymization routines, and open licensing.
- **Iteration cadence:** Sets weekly syncs and asynchronous review windows.

> **Remember:** If a study doesn’t need a specific safeguard, leave the section blank and the published guide will automatically omit it.

## Field kit assembly

We co-create modular kits to collect data in different environments. Each kit includes labeled containers, calibration cards, and QR codes linking to configuration videos.

### Deployment flow

1. **Prepare:** Print the packing list and verify each component has a tracking label.
2. **Calibrate:** Run the `SensorCheck` script against the baseline dataset.
3. **Document:** Take photos of the setup and log environmental conditions in the shared repository.
4. **Sync:** Upload data bundles nightly; the pipeline validates schemas and flags anomalies.

## Community lab sessions

We host open sessions to review instruments, calibrate sensors, and validate data processes. Participants can fork documentation, test new configurations, and propose improvements. This ensures the final tool remains adaptable and accountable to those collecting the information.

| Session type | Focus | Recommended duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware clinic | Check wear, replace consumables, update firmware | 90 minutes |
| Data immersion | Explore datasets, clean outliers, draft findings | 2 hours |
| Replication sprint | Repeat the experiment with new participants | Half day |

Publishing results is just the beginning. We encourage teams to iterate, share learnings, and invite others to replicate experiments. Collaboration keeps the scientific method alive and accessible.
