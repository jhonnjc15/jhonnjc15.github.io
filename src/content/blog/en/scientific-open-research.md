Working with scientists and citizen researchers means embracing transparency. Every project starts with an open canvas where we document hypotheses, equipment needs, and ethical considerations. That shared plan guides the hardware design and software pipelines we develop at Paqari Open Lab.

We host open sessions to review the instrumentation, calibrate sensors, and validate data flows. Participants can fork our documentation, test new configurations, and suggest improvements. The process ensures that the final tool remains adaptable and accountable to the people collecting the data.

Publishing the results is just the beginning. We encourage teams to keep iterating, publish their learnings, and invite others to replicate the experiments. Collaboration keeps the scientific method alive and accessible.
