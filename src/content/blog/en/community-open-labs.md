We run open-lab pop-ups so teams can prototype with us without leaving their neighborhoods. Each session blends quick demos, hands-on kits, and time for participants to adapt the tools to their own projects.

## What the mobile lab brings

Our traveling kit focuses on the essentials so teams can set up in under 20 minutes.

- Field-ready sensors with printed wiring guides.
- Tablets preloaded with tutorials and checklists.
- A mini print station for labels, QR codes, and consent forms.

> **Tip:** If a venue already has connectivity, switch the tutorials to streaming mode and free up tablet storage for media capture.

## Co-creation blocks

We split each visit into three repeatable blocks that any host team can remix:

1. **Orientation (15 min):** Agree on the question to explore and safety rules.
2. **Build + test (45 min):** Assemble sensors or storytelling props and document what changes.
3. **Share-out (20 min):** Capture voice notes, photos, and next steps in the shared workspace.

## Handing off the lab

Every host leaves with a lightweight archive so they can run the next session on their own:

- A localized copy of the checklists and facilitation cues.
- Links to download the same firmware and data templates we used on-site.
- A translationKey in the Markdown frontmatter that pairs this story with its Spanish version, keeping routes synchronized across languages.

If you want to add your own article, duplicate this file, translate the body, keep the same `translationKey`, and change the filename to the desired slug. The site will automatically connect the locales when both versions share that key.
