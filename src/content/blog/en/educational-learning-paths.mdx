  - Educational
type: guide
objective: "Turn a complex topic into a modular learning path that facilitators can replicate."
materials:
  - "Learning path map template"
  - "Activity cards (print or digital)"
  - "Facilitation checklist"
  - "Visual resources and local examples"
steps:
  - title: "Discovery session"
    body: |
      Start with a 30-minute conversation to understand how the group currently approaches the topic.

      - Capture motivating examples that can anchor later explanations.
      - Identify constraints such as space, connectivity, or accessibility requirements.
    tips:
      - "Store findings in the shared Notion board for reuse." 
  - title: "Path prototyping"
    body: |
      Adapt the library of micro-experiences based on discovery insights. Each activity card should cover setup, facilitation notes, and troubleshooting.

      Swap or remove cards freely; if a section isn’t in the Markdown notebook, it won’t appear on the site.

    tips:
      - "Use quick voting stickers to prioritize what resonates." 
  - title: "Implementation and measurement"
    body: |
      During the pilot, track emotions, collaboration, and learning milestones.

      1. Use a `Check-in` form at the end of each module.
      2. Document with photos or short clips (with consent).
      3. Close with a retrospective to decide what to adjust.
    warnings:
      - "Prepare analog backups if connectivity is limited."

Learning should feel like a conversation, not an endless list of instructions. At Paqari Open Lab we start every project by mapping the real challenges people face while learning. That research becomes a path that blends in-person experiences, digital resources, and community accompaniment.

## A quick look at the learning map

We open each project with a visual map showing how each module strengthens a specific skill. It includes required materials, estimated time per activity, and links to optional add-ons. Facilitators can print it or keep it on a tablet while moving between spaces.

## Tool library

All deliverables live in our open repository. Facilitators can download only what they need and skip the rest.

| Deliverable | Purpose | When to update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Narrative script | Guides the flow of each module | After major theme changes |
| Visual support kit | Printable posters and quick slides | When new examples are added |
| Evaluation checklist | Tracks skills, attitudes, and collaboration indicators | After each pilot |
| Community follow-up emails | Keep the cohort engaged with new challenges | Quarterly or per cohort |

## Facilitator checklist

1. Review the learning map and remove optional blocks you won’t use.
2. Adjust icebreakers to match the participants’ context.
3. Prepare analog backups for any digital interaction in case connectivity fails.
4. Print reflection cards or preload them on the shared tablet.
5. Schedule a handoff with the next facilitator to transfer improvements.

The result is a modular journey facilitators can remix and adapt for new audiences. We document everything—from scripts and visual aids to checklists—so other teams can expand the program without starting from scratch.
