Learning should feel like a conversation rather than a long list of instructions. At Paqari Open Lab we start every project by mapping the real problems that learners face. That investigation becomes a learning path that mixes physical experiences, digital resources, and community support.

## Journey map at a glance

We always begin with a visual map that shows how each module builds toward a clear skill. It includes the required materials, the estimated time per activity, and links to any optional add-ons. Facilitators can print it or load it on a tablet when they are on the move.

### Step 1 — Kickoff discovery session

1. Host a 30-minute conversation to learn how the group currently approaches the topic.
2. Capture motivating examples that can anchor later explanations.
3. Identify constraints such as space, connectivity, or accessibility needs.

> **Tip:** Save the insights directly in the shared Notion dashboard so other facilitators can reuse them.

### Step 2 — Prototype the pathway

We adapt our library of micro-experiments to match the discovery insights. Each activity card includes setup instructions, facilitator notes, and troubleshooting scenarios. Swap or remove cards freely—if a section is not present in the Markdown playbook it simply stays hidden on the website.

### Step 3 — Deploy and measure

During the pilot we track emotional responses, collaboration moments, and knowledge checkpoints.

- Use the `Check-in` form after every module to gather quick reflections.
- Record photos or short clips (with consent) to document how participants interact with the materials.
- Wrap up with a collective retrospective to decide which modules remain, which need updates, and which should be archived.

## Toolkit reference

All deliverables live in our open repository. Facilitators can download only the parts they need and ignore the rest.

| Deliverable | Purpose | When to update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story-driven script | Guides the narrative flow for each module | After major theme changes |
| Visual aids pack | Printable posters and slides for quick explanations | When new examples are added |
| Assessment checklist | Tracks skills, attitudes, and collaboration indicators | After every pilot |
| Community follow-up emails | Keeps alumni engaged with new challenges | Quarterly or per cohort |

## Facilitation checklist

1. Review the journey map and remove optional blocks you will not cover.
2. Customize the icebreakers so they resonate with the participants' context.
3. Prepare analog backups for any digital interaction in case the internet fails.
4. Print the reflection cards or preload them on the shared tablet.
5. Schedule a debrief with the next facilitator so improvements carry forward.

The result is a modular journey where facilitators can remix sections and adapt them to new audiences. We document everything—from scripts and visual aids to evaluation checklists—so future teams can expand the program without starting from scratch.
