  - Scientific
type: lab
level: "Intermediate – Advanced"
duration: "2–4 hours"
objective: "Obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or graphene via electrochemical exfoliation of graphite."
theory: |
  Electrochemical exfoliation applies a potential to graphite to separate its layers and generate graphene-like materials. At the anode, oxidation promotes layer delamination, while the electrolyte controls exfoliation rate and defect density.
materials:
  - "Electrolyte A (mild): Na₂SO₄ 0.1 M"
  - "Electrolyte B (oxidizing): H₂SO₄ 0.1–1 M"
  - "Distilled water"
  - "Ethanol (final rinse)"
equipment:
  - "DC power supply (0–20 V, 0–2 A)"
  - "Graphite electrodes (bars or rods)"
  - "Counter electrode: stainless steel or graphite"
  - "Electrode holders and alligator clips"
  - "Beaker (250–500 mL)"
  - "Magnetic stirrer (optional)"
  - "Glass stirrer or spatula"
  - "Vacuum filter or Büchner funnel with filter paper"
safety:
  - "Wear gloves, safety goggles, and a lab coat."
  - "Handle H₂SO₄ with extreme care and always add acid to water."
  - "Work in a fume hood when using H₂SO₄."
steps:
  - title: "Prepare the electrolyte"
    body: |
      Dissolve the chosen reagent in distilled water (e.g., 2.84 g of Na₂SO₄ in 200 mL to obtain 0.1 M).

      Pour the solution into a 250 mL beaker and set up the workspace.

    tips:
      - "Label the solution with concentration and preparation date."
  - title: "Set up the electrochemical cell"
    body: |
      Connect a graphite rod as the anode (positive) and another as the cathode (negative).

      Keep them 3–5 cm apart and immerse both in the solution without contact.

    warnings:
      - "Ensure the electrodes do not touch to avoid short circuits."
  - title: "Apply voltage"
    body: |
      Power on the supply and apply a constant 10–12 V for 30–60 minutes.

      Observe bubbling and the detachment of thin dark layers from the anode.

    tips:
      - "Log the current to correlate with exfoliated material yield."
  - title: "Collect and rinse"
    body: |
      After completion, let the mixture settle or filter the liquid to recover the suspended dark material.

      Rinse several times with distilled water until neutral pH, then finish with an ethanol rinse.

  - title: "Dry the material"
    body: |
      Dry the filtered material in an oven at 60–80 °C for several hours or air-dry.

      Store in a labeled amber vial.

expected_results:
  - "Dark suspension with thin graphene or rGO sheets."
  - "Dry material ready for Raman, SEM/TEM, or FTIR characterization."
notes:
  - "Changing the electrolyte allows control over defect density and sheet size."
  - "The product can be chemically reduced with ascorbic acid or Na₂S₂O₄."

## Optional – Post reduction

If graphene oxide is obtained, it can be reduced to rGO using agents such as:

- Ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
- Sodium hydrosulfite (Na₂S₂O₄)
- Thermal treatment (>200 °C)

## Additional notes

The product can be characterized with UV-Vis, Raman, SEM/TEM, FTIR, or XRD if equipment is available. Adjust conditions to optimize the balance between yield and structural quality.
