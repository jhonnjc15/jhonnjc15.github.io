    Paqari OpenLab draws from the Quechua word for “dawn,” signaling a future of accessible science.
    We build a modular, portable lab that blends technology, creativity, and community so any
    classroom can experiment with chemistry, energy, and nanotech without barriers.

  title: "Ripple of Change"
  description: >-
    By 2030, 170 million new STEM jobs are projected. Every practice we enable brings learners
    closer to those opportunities through safe, low-consumption methods replicable in classrooms,
    in the field, or in industry.
